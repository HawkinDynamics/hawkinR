\usage{
get_tests_team(teamId, from, to)
}
\arguments{
\item{teamId}{Supply a team’s or a string of a comma separated list of group id’s to receive tests from
specific groups. Recommended to use method \code{paste0()}. A maximum of 10 groups can be fetched at once.}

\item{from}{Optionally supply a time (Unix timestamp) you want the tests from. If you do not
supply this value you will receive every test. This parameter is best suited for bulk exports of
historical data.}

\item{to}{Optionally supply a time (Unix timestamp) you want the tests to. If you do not
supply this value you will receive every test from the beginning of time or the optionally
supplied \code{from} parameter. This parameter is best suited for bulk exports of historical data.}
}
