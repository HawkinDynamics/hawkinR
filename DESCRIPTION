Description: Provides simple functionality with Hawkin Dynamics API. These functions are for use
 with 'Hawkin Dynamics Beta API' version 1.8-beta. Must be HD user with active integration account

 database into your own database. It is not designed to be accessed from client applications directly.
 There is a limit on the amount of data that can be returned in a single request. As your database 
 grows, it will be necessary to use the from and to parameters to limit the size of the responses. 
 Responses that exceed the memory limit will fail.
