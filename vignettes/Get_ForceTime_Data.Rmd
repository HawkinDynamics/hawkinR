# get tests from google sheets

```

There are many cases in which a user would want to access the raw data from a test trial. Just like the rest of your data, you can access the same data used to create the force plot in your app and cloud. With just a couple of lines of code, you can call in the force-time data from any test in your system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Get Access

Like always, the first step to getting your data is initializing your session. Simply load the hawkinR package and run the `get_access` function.

```{r access, eval=FALSE }
# load the hawkinR package
library(hawkinR)

# initialize your current session
get_access(refreshToken = 'your_integration_key', region = 'your_region')

```

## 2. Get Tests

For this example, I am going to call for only my tests. To do this I am going to need to get my unique ID first. So that I can include that in the `get_tests_ath` function.

```{r getMyTests, eval=FALSE}
# create a data frame of my athlete info 
roster <- get_athletes()

# My Athlete ID
myID <- roster$id[roster$name == "Lauren Green"]

# call your tests
myTests <- get_tests_ath(athleteId = myID)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tests <- read_sheet(ss = sheetcode, sheet = "Sheet1")

tests <- tests %>%
  select(id, segment, testType.canonicalId, athlete.name)

kable(tests)
```

## 3. Get Test ID

Now that I have a list of the tests I want to evaluate, I can call for the force-time data I want by using the tests unique ID.

Every test has it's own unique identifier. This is all that's needed to get your test data. The test Id is found in the first column of any of the `get_tests` function returns.

In this example, I am calling the first test of my data frame, which is a CMJ trial.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Get the ID of the test
myTestID <- myTests$id[1]

# Get the force-time data
myFT <- get_forcetime(testId = myTestID)
```

```{r,  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

ftData <- read_sheet(ss = sheetcode, sheet = "Sheet2")

ftDataShort <- head(ftData)

kable(ftDataShort)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And just like that we have our force-time data. You can do this to with any of your test types.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Plot made with the echarts4R package"}

df <- ftData %>%
  transmute(
    t = time_s,
    Fc = force_combined,
    d = displacement_m,
    v = velocity_m_s
  )

sw <- mean(df$Fc[1:1000])

sm <- df %>%
  filter(cumsum(d != 0) > 0) %>%
  slice_min(order_by = t, n = 1) %>%
  pull('t')

to <- df %>%
  filter(Fc < 10 & v > 0) %>%
  slice_min(order_by = t, n = 1) %>%
  pull('t')

mv <- df %>%
  filter(t < to) %>%
  slice_min(order_by = v, n = 1) %>%
  pull('t')


brk <- df %>%
  filter(t > mv & t < to & Fc >= sw) %>%
  slice_min(order_by = v, n = 1) %>%
  pull('t')

prp <- df %>%
  filter(t > brk & v > 0)%>%
  slice_min(order_by = t, n = 1) %>%
  pull('t')

plotdf <- df %>%
  filter(t >= sm & t < to) %>%
  mutate(
    phase = case_when(
      t >= sm & t < brk ~ "unw",
      t >= brk & t < prp ~ "brk",
      t >= prp & t < to ~ "prp"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(t, Fc, phase) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "phase",
    values_from = "Fc"
  )

plot <- plotdf |>
  e_chart(t, name = "Time (s)") |>
  e_area(unw, name = "Unweighting", color = "#e6d800") |>
  e_area(brk, name = "Breaking", color = "#e60049") |>
  e_area(prp, name = "Propulsive", color = "#00bfa0") |>
  e_x_axis(
    name = "Time (s)",
    nameLocation = "center",
    nameGap = "25",
    max = to,
    min = sm
  ) |>
  e_y_axis(
    name = "Total Force (N)",
    nameLocation = "center",
    nameRotate = "90",
    nameGap = "45"
  ) |>
  e_theme("chalk") |>
  e_title(
    text = "CMJ Phases", 
    subtext = "Force-Time Amalysis of Countermovent Jump", 
    left = "center"
  ) |>
  e_legend(bottom = TRUE) |>
  e_tooltip(trigger = "axis") |>
  e_toolbox_feature(feature = "dataZoom")
